            more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>
          <p class="card__details">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make
            a
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
            for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
            the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

          <p class="card__details">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
            refreshing.
            The program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
            an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>

          <p class="card__headline">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
          <p class="card__details">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
            structure from
            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
            project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
            could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
            experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
